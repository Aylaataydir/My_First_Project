                        <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or
                            artificial rock wallswithout the use of ropes or harnesses. </p>
                        <p>Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing" target="_blank">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short
                            but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance
                            from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.
                        </p>

                        endlessly challenging for experts.</strong></p>
